LunarPhases V1.0

Place the files in this archive in a subdirectory off the directory where you
keep your HTML files (e.g. name the subdirectory: LunarPhases). Add the
following lines to the HTML file in which the applet will be displayed:

<P ALIGN=CENTER><applet code="LunarPhases.class" CODEBASE="LunarPhases/"
width="400" height="160" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE"></applet></CENTER></P>

That's it!

You can test the applet using the included LunarPhases.htm file.


Notes

This applet displays the current phase of the moon and the time/date of the 
next four major lunar phases. The current age of the moon, its distance and 
apogee/perigee dates are also displayed. All times displayed are in UT except 
for the clock which displays the local time.

If anyone finds any bugs or problems with a specific browser (or version) drop 
me a line.
